# Summary Report

## Number of Participants

Total: 31, *(Glass On: 11, Off: 20)*

## Appropriate Length of class

**40-45 Minutes** (Most of the students are okay with this range)

## Attention Span

Most of the students mentioned an attention span of **15-20 minutes**. Perhaps it would be better if the class is divided into 2 sessions and there is a 5-minute break between them.

### Possible reasons for losing attention

*Excluding students' interest in lesson content and how it is being taught.*

- Internet connection interruption. Difficult to catch up if some part of the lecture is missed.
- Smartphone notification, calls, messages. *Using "Focus Mode" (introduced in android 9) could be a solution.*
- House noise/distractions

## Preferred Device

Only 7 students preferred Smartphones over Laptops/Desktops.

### Reason for choosing

Sometimes students are required to do small household chores during the classes.

### Problem

Higher chance of getting distracted by notifications, messages, and calls.

## Usual ROI of slides

- Usually, pictures/equations are usually in the middle-middle or upper-middle.
- Descriptions are left-justified, so upper-left and upper-right get more important contents.
- If the instructor does live coding (I did that during my Software Engineering and Design pattern classes), bottom-left and bottom-mid get more focus.

## Preference on sharing video feed

### Comfortable(?): 0011000100100000000101001010000 *(Comfortable = 1, Instructors' camera is also on)*

8 students are comfortable with sharing their video feed. It makes classes more interactive and students will take the classes more seriously. Allows students to grab the teacher's attention easily.

## Video share vs Gaze Tracking

#### *Only the students **not comfortable** with sharing their video feed were asked this question.*

Participants were explained how the gaze tracking system will work. They were also assured that the instructor will only be able to monitor the attention of the whole class only (not individual students).

### Gaze Tracking Pros

- There can be 4-5 classes per day. It might not be always possible to maintain an appropriate look and background as many of the participants did not have personal rooms in their homes.
- If the video is on, some students might feel conscious about their looks. It might affect their attention.
- The teacher is able to monitor whether the class is able to follow the lecture or not.

### Gaze Tracking Cons

- Course teacher might develop a negative impression if he/she notices bad attention scores from class. It might effect overall class result for the course.
- The teacher is not able to watch students' facial expressions. So, the problem remains.
