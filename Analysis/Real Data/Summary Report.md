# Summary Report
## Number of Participants: 
Total: 31, *(Glass On: 11, Off: 20)*

## Appropriate Length of class: 
**40-45 Minutes** (Most of the students are okay with this range)

## Attention Span: 
Most of the students mentioned an attention span of **15-20 minutes**. Perhaps it would be better if the class is devided in 2 sessions and there is a 5 minute break between them.

### Possible reasons for losing attentions:
*Excluding students' interest on lesson content and how it is being taught.*
- Internet connection interruption. Difficult to catch up if some part of the lecture is missed.
- Smartphone notification, calls, message. *Using "Focus Mode" (introduced in android 9) could be a solution.*
- House noise/distrations

## Preferred Device: 
Only 7 students preferred Smartphones over Laptops/Desktops. 
### Reason for choosing: 
Sometimes students are required to do small household chores during the classes.
### Problem: 
Higher chance of getting distracted by notifications, messages and calls. 

## Usual ROI of slides: 
- Usually pitures/equations are usually in middle-middle or upper middle.
- Descriptions are left justified, so upper-left and upper-right get more important contents.
- If the instructor does live coding (I did that during my Software Engineering and Design pattern classes), bottom-left and bottom-mid get more focus.

## Preference on sharing video feed: 
### Comfortable(?): 0011000100100000000101001010000 *(Comfortable = 1, Instructors' camera is also on)*  
8 students are comfortable with sharing their video feed. It makes classes more interactive and stdents will take the classes more seriously. Allowes students to grab teachers attention easily. 

## Video share vs Gaze Tracking:
#### *Only the students **not comfortable** with sharing their video feed were asked this question.*
Participants were explained how the gaze tracking system will work. They were also assured that the instructor will only be able to monitor the attention of whole class only (not individual students).

### Gaze Tracking Pros:
- There can be 4-5 classes per day. It might not be always possible to maintain professsional look and backgrounds as many of the participants did not have personal rooms in their home.
- If the video is on, some students might feel conscious about their looks. It might affect their attention.
- Teacher is able to monitor whether the class is able to follow the lecture or not. 

### Gaze Tracking Cons:
- Teacher might develop a negative impression if he/she notices bad attention scores from class. It might effect overall class result for the course.
- Teacher is not able to watch students' facial expressions. So, the problem remains.
